#MAZE RUNNER 3D GAME                                                                                           
## Introduction
Maze Runner is a simple 3D game implemented in C using OpenGL. The game involves navigating a car through a maze environment, avoiding collisions, changing the car's colors, catch power-ups and find a teapot to exit from the maze.

## Features
- **Car Movement:** Control the car using keyboard inputs (up, down, left, right).
- **Car Color Customization:** Change the color of the car body and wheels through the right-click menu.
- **Camera Control:** Adjust the camera angle using mouse movements.
- **Collision Detection:** Prevent the car from moving through walls by detecting collisions.
- **Power-ups:** Increase the speed of the car, Increase timer , Decrease the speed of the car and size.
- **Fog:** Low visibility.

## How to Play
1. **Controls:**
    - *Up Arrow Key:* Move the car forward.
    - *Down Arrow Key:* Move the car backward.
    - *Left/Right Arrow Keys:* Rotate the car left or right.
    - *Mouse Drag:* Control the camera view angle.
    - *'S' key:* Start the game
    - *'Z' key:* Start the game in hardcore mode.
    - *'R' key:* Restart the game.

2. **Menu Options:**
    - *Right-Click Menu:* Change car colors or reset the camera angle.

## Setup and Running the Game
1. **Requirements:**
    - OpenGL library
    - C compiler

2. **Compiling the Code:**
    - Compile the code with your C compiler.

3. **Running the Game:**
    - Execute the compiled program to start the game.

## Usage
- Use the arrow keys to navigate the car through the maze.
- Right-click to access the menu and change the car's colors or reset the camera.
- Catch the power-ups to win advantage (or not)
- Find the teapot to win the game!

## Future Improvements
- Adding maze generation algorithms for dynamic maze creation.
- Implementing different maze levels with increasing difficulties.
- Enhancing the game interface and adding scoring mechanisms.
